## Introduction

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. This repository contains a simple "Hello World" application to help you get started with FastAPI and Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: [Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Git**: [Get Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these simple steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moyed/fastapi-docker.git
cd fastapi-docker
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Next, build the Docker image for the FastAPI application:

```bash
docker build -t fastapi-hello-world . 
```

### 3. Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, run the Docker container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi-hello-world
```

## Testing the Application

Now that your application is running, it‚Äôs time to test it! üéâ

Open your web browser and go to:


```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

You should see a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù message displayed. Congratulations, you‚Äôre up and running with FastAPI and Docker! üéä

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

    - Docker Build Issues: Ensure Docker is running and you‚Äôre in the correct directory.
    - Port Conflicts: Make sure port 8000 is not being used by another application.
    - Network Issues: Check your Docker network settings if you can‚Äôt access the application.
